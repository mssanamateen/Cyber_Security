Malware Dataset Overview
Your dataset contains 100,000 records with 35 columns, comprising both numerical and categorical features. 
Key Features
hash (String) – Unique identifier for each file/sample.

classification (Categorical - malware or benign) – The target variable (label).

Various system-related numeric features:

state, usage_counter, prio, static_prio, normal_prio, policy – Scheduler or priority-related parameters.

Memory-related features: vm_pgoff, vm_truncate_count, task_size, cached_hole_size, free_area_cache, etc.

CPU execution times: utime, stime, gtime, cgtime.

Page faults: min_flt (minor faults), maj_flt (major faults).

Process switching: nvcsw, nivcsw, signal_nvcsw.

Possible Approach for Classification
Feature Selection – Remove unnecessary columns like hash, as it doesn’t contribute to learning.

Data Preprocessing – Normalize numerical features and encode categorical labels.

Train a Machine Learning Model – Try Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks for classification.

Evaluation – Use accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
